Ruby Scheme aims to be an implementation of Scheme (what version of the
standard or are we aiming at the standard at all?). What sets it apart
from other Ruby Schemes is it's ability to interop with Ruby, Clojure
style.

Like in Clojure native Ruby methods can be called on builtin types:

(.join '("Hello" "world") " ") ; ["Hello", "world"].join(" ")

The aim should be to encourage side effect free programming (i.e.
immutability).

## Simple Beginning ##

The interpreted should be able to evaluate a single atom expression and
return that atom as it's value.

1
=> 1

We should start by wrapping everything in Ruby data-structs to avoid
having to worry about parsing.

## Next step #

Next up is pairs or a cons. Each Cons has a Car and a Cdr:

'(a)     ; car = a, cdr = nil
'(a b)   ; car = a, cdr = (b)
'(a b c) ; car = a, cdr = (b c)

Every Cdr is a Cons, too.

## Types ##

### Basic types ###

1     ; Integer
"str" ; String
'sym  ; Symbol
'(a b c) ; List of ?
nil   ; NicClass
#t    ; TrueClass
#f    ; FalseClass


### Advanced types ###

3.14   ; Float
/re/   ; Regexp
1..10  ; Range
